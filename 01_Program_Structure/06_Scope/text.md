# 🔄 Scope in Go

## 📘 Explanation

**🧠 What is Scope?**

Scope means **where something is allowed to be seen or used** — like where a student is allowed to go inside a school.

**Types of Scope in Go**

**1.Package Scope — The Whole School**
Imagine the whole school building. Some announcements are posted on the school’s main bulletin board. Everyone in the school (all classrooms) can see it.

**2.Function Scope — The Classroom**
Inside one classroom, the teacher calls a student’s name. Only that classroom can hear and respond.

**3.Block Scope — The Desk Area**
Inside the classroom, a student raises their hand only in their desk area. Only students at that desk notice.

## 🧱 Why Use Scopes in Programming?

**1. Keep Things Organized**
Imagine if every student in the whole school had access to every single classroom’s desk notes — it would be chaotic!
Scopes keep variables and functions organized and limited to where they belong, so your program doesn’t get messy.

**2. Avoid Name Conflicts**
Two classrooms might have students named "Alex". Because of scopes, the “Alex” in one classroom is different from the “Alex” in another — no confusion.

Similarly, variables with the same name in different scopes don’t clash.

**3. Control Access**
Scopes help control who can use or change data. Some information should only be known inside a small area (like inside a function), while others might be shared more widely.

**4. Memory Efficiency**
Variables inside smaller scopes (like inside a function or block) only exist when needed, saving memory.

**5. Helps Debugging**
When you know where variables live and can be accessed, it’s easier to find and fix bugs.



## ✅ Example Code

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Package scope variable — visible throughout the whole school (package)
var schoolAnnouncement = "School starts at 8 AM"

func main() {
    // Function scope variable — visible only inside this classroom (main function)
    classroomNotice := "Math test on Friday"
    fmt.Println(schoolAnnouncement)  // Accessible everywhere in the school
    fmt.Println(classroomNotice)     // Accessible inside the classroom

    if true {
        // Block scope variable — visible only inside the desk area (if block)
        deskNote := "Bring calculator"
        fmt.Println(deskNote)  // Accessible here only
    }

    // fmt.Println(deskNote) // ERROR: deskNote not visible outside desk area
}

```

## 🧪 Sample Output

```
School starts at 8 AM
Math test on Friday
Bring calculator

```
